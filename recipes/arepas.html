    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A South American staple, particularly in Venezuela and Colombia, arepas
      are stuffed cornmeal cakes that are crispy outside and fluffy inside.
      They're a popular food item for street vendors, but are also regularly
      made in homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The filling choices depend on which region — or even household — you're
      cooking in. You can stuff them with ingredients like meat, eggs, beans,
      pumpkin, cheese, and more.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2½ cups of lukewarm water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
      <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.®)</li>
      <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
      <li>Any fillings of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in
        cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist,
        malleable dough.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten
        into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches
        until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked
        arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to
        handle.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife
        to form a pita-like pocket.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Add any fillings of your choice and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
